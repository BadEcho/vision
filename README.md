## Comprehensive Overview

For a detailed look at what Vision is and how it works, please refer to its dedicated article:
[Vision: An Omnified Game Overlay](https://badecho.com/index.php/2022/02/14/vision/)

This article provides some high-level design as well as diving deep into all of the various parts that make it work.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, it also focuses on game development and providing entertainment through the clever manipulation of games (the results of which are streamed by myself).

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
