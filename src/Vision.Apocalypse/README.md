The `BadEcho.Vision.Apocalypse` library is a module plugin for Vision that grants insight into the mysteries of the Omnified Apocalypse system. It does this by displaying all the Apocalypse-related events occurring in the game.

This module exists to be used with Vision for the purpose of delivering a live Omnified experience on stream, but is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License so that others may enjoy it as well; see the accompanying [license](https://github.com/BadEcho/vision/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

## Comprehensive Overview

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, it also focuses on game development and providing entertainment through the clever manipulation of games (the results of which are streamed by myself).

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
